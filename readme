Here’s what the ER (Entity Relationship) diagram for the BM-Shop would look like conceptually, based on the tables and relationships:

ER Diagram Description:
Customers (1) --- (M) Orders

A customer can have multiple orders.
Orders (1) --- (M) Order_Items

An order can have multiple order items (many products in an order).
Order_Items (M) --- (1) Products

Many order items can relate to a single product.
Products (M) --- (1) Categories

Each product belongs to a single category.
Orders (1) --- (1) Payments

Each order has one payment.
Visualizing the relationships:
Customers and Orders: One customer can place many orders.
Orders and Order_Items: An order can have many items.
Order_Items and Products: Many items can refer to one product.
Products and Categories: Products belong to a single category.
Orders and Payments: One order has one payment.
